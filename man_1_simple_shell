.SH NAME

hsh \- command interpreter (shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS

hsh [-o option_name] [+o option_name] [command_file [argument ...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION

This program simulates a command interpreter based in Unix and GNU/LINUX with its basic commands.
through a terminal emulator and some executable instructions(shell scripts) the user can interact with this \fBsimple_shell.\fR

This simple_shell is not supossed to be an exact imitation of the original Unix Shell. This doesn't cover all of the instructions the original does.


.SH OVERVIEW

Reading from either the terminal or files, simple_shell interprets and executes commands.

.I PATH.
It does not yet handle piping, redirection, pattern matching, variable expansions, and more extra functions.
.SS Invocation
An
.I interactive
simple shell can be invoked by typing ./simple_shell. Meanwhile, a
.I non-interactive
simple shell can also be invoked via a pipe (e.g. echo "/bin/ls" | ./simple_shell).
.SS Command Execution
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.
.sp
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name that function is invoked. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.
.sp
If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, the simple shell searches each element of the environmental variable PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name. If the search is unsuccessful, the simple shell prints an error message "Error: File or description not found."i

.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS

Builtin commands that replicate the original UNIX shell:

.PP

.B - exit

Terminates the program.
.sp
.B - env

Prints the enviromental variables and their values to standard output.
.sp
